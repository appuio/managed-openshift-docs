= OpenShift Service Mesh

RedHat OpenShift Service Mesh is a tool for traffic management, tracing, service authentication and access policy enforcement within the OpenShift cluster.
It's based on Istio, Kiali, and Jaeger.


== Use cases

=== Traffic management

OpenShift Service Mesh can be used to manage in-cluster traffic between services and allows for centralized configuration of traffic patterns such as load balancing, rate limiting or circuit breakers.

=== Deployment patterns

A service mesh enables continuous deployment patterns based on automated testing and traffic switchover, such as canary deployments or dark launches.

=== Observability and Distributed Tracing

OpenShift Service Mesh comes with Jaeger for distributed tracing.
Tracing is an important tool to understand the behaviour of a complex microservice architecture under load, as it allows identifying bottlenecks and sources of latency.

=== Authentication and Authorization

Using OpenShift Service Mesh, you can leverage Istio's capabilities for authentication and authorization between services or between the user and your application.
