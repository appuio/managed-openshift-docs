= Getting started with OpenShift Service Mesh

This tutorial explains how to use the OpenShift Service Mesh to manage the bookinfo demo application.


== Requirements

To follow this guide, please make sure that you have the following tools installed:

`oc`:: You can download the OpenShift command directly from OpenShift Web Console. Open the help menu (marked as a question mark at the top right) and select the "Command line tools" entry.


== Step 1: Creating the ServiceMeshControlPlane

The ServiceMeshControlPlane manages all services that are part of a service mesh.
Creating multiple control planes allows for creating multiple independent service meshes, for example in a multi-tenancy environment.

. Create a new namespace called `demo-ossm-controlplane`
+
[source,shell]
--
oc new-project demo-ossm-controlplane
--
+
[TIP]
====
If you get an error that the namespace already exists, please pick another name and try again.
We recommend prefixing the name with the name of your organization to minimize potential for name collisions.
====

. Create a ServiceMeshControlPlane
+
[source,shell]
--
oc create -n demo-ossm-controlplane -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  version: v2.3
  tracing:
    type: Jaeger
    sampling: 10000
  addons:
    jaeger:
      name: jaeger
      install:
        storage:
          type: Memory
    kiali:
      enabled: true
      name: kiali
    grafana:
      enabled: true
EOF
--

. Watch the progress of the control plane deployment
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get pods -n demo-ossm-controlplane -w
--

. Verify the control plane is ready
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get smcp -n demo-ossm-controlplane
--
+
You should see your new ServiceMeshControlPlane with status `ComponentsReady`.


== Step 2: Creating the Service Mesh member roll

The ServiceMeshMemberRoll associates OpenShift projects with ServiceMeshControlPlanes.
Each project can belong to only one Control Plane, but one Control Plane can manage multiple projects.
The ServiceMeshControlPlane can only manage services in projects that are associated with it via a ServiceMeshMemberRoll.

. Create a new project to contain the application that shall be part of the service mesh
+
[source,shell]
--
oc new-project demo-ossm-bookinfo
--
. Create a ServiceMeshMemberRoll in the control plane namespace to associate this new project with the control plane
+
[source,shell]
--
oc create -n demo-ossm-controlplane -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  members:
    - demo-ossm-bookinfo
EOF
--

. Verify the ServiceMeshMemberRoll was successfully created
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get smmr -n demo-ossm-controlplane default
--
+
A status of `Configured` indicates that installation was successful.


== Step 3: Deploying the bookinfo demo application

`bookinfo` is a small sample application which is built from microservices.
It displays information about a book.
The main `productpage` service calls other microservices to collect information and reviews pertaining to a book.

. Deploy the Bookinfo application from its manifest:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc apply -n demo-ossm-bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-2.3/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
--

. Deploy the ingress gateway, which allows public access to the application
+
[source,bash]
--
oc apply -n demo-ossm-bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-2.3/samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
--

. Deploy the destination rules for the application, which configure the routing between the individual microservices
+
[source,bash]
--
oc apply -n demo-ossm-bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-2.3/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml
--

. Verify all pods are ready
+
[source,bash]
--
oc get pods -n demo-ossm-bookinfo
--

== Step 4: Enable sidecar injection
To avoid interference between different operators, the OpenShift Service Mesh controller refuses to touch any deployments that aren't annotated a certain way.
We need to add this annotation to all our deployments to allow the controller to inject the necessary sidecars.

. Check all the deployments of our application
+
[source,bash]
--
oc get deployment -n demo-ossm-bookinfo
--

. Add the annotation to all deployments
+
[source,bash]
--
oc get deployment -n demo-ossm-bookinfo -o NAME | while read line ; do oc annotate "$line" -n demo-ossm-bookinfo "sidecar.istio.io/inject=true" ; done
--
+
NOTE: The bookinfo application technically already has sidecar injection enabled by default.
However, the step is highlighted here anyways, since it's necessary on any custom workloads.

. View the bookinfo application in your browser
+
Run the following to get the application URL:
+
[source,bash]
--
export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n demo-ossm-controlplane get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo "http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage"
--
. You can use the following command to generate some traffic to your application for testing:
+
[source,bash]
--
while true ; do curl "http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage" > /dev/null ; sleep 1 ; done
--


== Step 5: Explore your microservices using the tools provided by OpenShift Service Mesh

. Navigate to kiali
.. Find the URL using this command:
+
[source,bash]
--
oc -n demo-ossm-controlplane get route kiali -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
--

.. Click on "Log In with OpenShift" to log into Kiali

.. Navigate to `Graph` to see an overview of your service mesh.
+

.. For more information on Kiali and its features, see https://kiali.io/docs/features/[the Kiali documentation].


. Navigate to Jaeger
.. Find the URL using this command:
+
[source,bash]
--
oc -n demo-ossm-controlplane get route jaeger -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
--
.. Click on "Log In with OpenShift" to log into Jaeger
.. Select a service in the drop-down (such as the `productpage` service) and click on `Find Traces` to query for your service's traces
+

.. For more information on Jaeger and its features, see https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/[the Jaeger documentation].


== Step 6: Cleanup

Once you no longer need your demo deployment of the `bookinfo` application and its `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, clean it up by deleting the corresponding projects:

[source,bash]
--
oc delete project demo-ossm-bookinfo
oc delete project demo-ossm-controlplane
--
