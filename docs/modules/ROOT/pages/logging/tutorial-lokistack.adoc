= Getting started with logging: Lokistack

This tutorial explains how to view the logs of an application on Openshift.


== Requirements

To follow this guide, please make sure that you have the following tools installed:

`oc`:: You can download the OpenShift command directly from OpenShift Web Console. Open the help menu (marked as a question mark at the top right) and select the "Command line tools" entry.


== Step 1: Deploy Fortune application

. Create a new namespace called `demo-fortune`
+
[source,shell]
--
oc new-project demo-fortune
--
+
[TIP]
====
If you get an error that the namespace already exists, please pick another name and try again.
We recommend prefixing the name with the name of your organization to minimize potential for name collisions.
====

. Create Fortune application manifest
+
.Manifest for Fortune application
[source,yaml]
--
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: fortune-cookie
  name: fortune-cookie
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fortune-cookie
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fortune-cookie
