kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: fortune-cookie
  name: fortune-cookie
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fortune-cookie
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fortune-cookie
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-go:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: fortune-cookie
